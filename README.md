# XRP-paper-wallet-generater
For XRP owner to have their own paper wallet
**Software Introduction**  
This utility is designed to generate XRP wallet addresses with specified prefixes **completely offline**. It is fully open source and packaged into a `.exe` file, making it easy to use even if you have no programming background. Below are its key features and benefits:

1. **Rejecting Any “Pre-Generated Wallet,” Including Hardware Wallets**  
   - Online wallet generators can be risky, as you can’t verify whether they store your private keys.  
   - **Hardware wallets** may also harbor potential backdoors or hidden vulnerabilities introduced by manufacturers.  
   - By generating your keys entirely on your own, you ensure no one else has access to them.

2. **Customizable Address Prefix**  
   - For example, you can create addresses starting with `rGod`, `rZM`, etc. Although this requires heavier computation, it strongly ensures the wallet truly belongs to you and wasn’t secretly generated by someone else.  
   - The more characters you specify, the longer it takes to find a matching address.

3. **Completely Offline Operation**  
   - For maximum security, run this program on a computer with a fresh operating system installation, and **disconnect from all networks** before generating addresses.  
   - You can then print out your private key or QR code to store in a fireproof safe, keeping it away from hackers or internet threats.

4. **Easy to Use**  
   - The `.exe` file doesn’t require a programming environment or an internet connection—just open it, enter the prefix you want and the number of concurrent threads, and let it search for matching addresses.

5. **Transparent & Trustworthy**  
   - All source code is **publicly available**. You can review or compile it yourself, eliminating concerns about hidden functions or backdoors.  
   - The logic is open and can be audited by anyone.

6. **Security Configuration Tips**  
   - You can use a standalone computer (with a freshly installed OS), plus a printer, to generate multiple addresses offline.  
   - Converting private keys to QR codes and printing them provides a convenient paper wallet solution. Store it in a fireproof safe for extra security.

7. **Longer Prefix = Longer Computation**  
   - The more characters you specify (e.g., `rGod` or `rZM`), the more time is needed to find a match.  
   - Start with shorter prefixes to confirm the software is working, then move on to longer ones if needed.
